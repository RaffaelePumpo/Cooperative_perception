### Collaborative Perception for Autonomous Vehicles

## Objectives:
1. Process and visualize LiDAR data from IRSU for vehicle perception.
2. Enhance vehicle perception using data from other vehicles and IRSU.
3. Construct an occupancy grid for environmental mapping.

## Description:
This lab focuses on the utilization of Intelligent Road-Side Unit (IRSU) data, particularly in the context of enhanced vehicle perception and environment mapping.

## Steps:
1. Task 1 - Visualizing LiDAR Data from IRSU:
   - Process and visualize point cloud data from a 32-channel LiDAR.

2. Task 2 - Enhancing Vehicle Perception with IRSU Data:
   - IRSU data can enhance the vehicle's field of view and perception range.

3. Task 3 - Building an Occupancy Grid:
   - Construct a Bird's Eye View (BEV) occupancy grid of the environment.
